# Rust Study Group Repository

Welcome to the Rust Study Group! This repository is where we collaborate and share our solutions to the *100 Exercises to Learn Rust*.  

## Guidelines  

1. **Create Your Own Branch**  
   - Use your Discord username as the name of your branch (e.g., `your-discord-name`).
   - Push your solutions to your branch only.

2. **Keep It Organized and Clean**  
   - Organize your solutions in a way that makes it easy for other learners to follow and understand.  
   - Add comments and documentation where necessary to explain your code.

3. **Start Date**  
   - The marathon begins on **22/11/2024**.  

4. **Ask for Help**  
   - If you get stuck, donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions in the Discord channel.  

## Good Luck!  
This is a great opportunity to learn and grow together as a community. Letâ€™s support each other and make the most out of this journey!  

Happy coding! ðŸš€
